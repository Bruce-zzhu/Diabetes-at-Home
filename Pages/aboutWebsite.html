                    This site is the flagship web app of Diabetes@Home, a startup
                    commited to providing digital health solutions to the wider
                    community. Our app services about 5,000 patients and 100
                    clinicians who are located in Victoria, Australia.
            </p>
            <h2>Okay, but what does this site actually do?</h2>
            <p>
                Our web app allows patients to easily record their health data.
                In turn, patients can track their progress and become more
                motivated to monitor their health.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, clinicians can also track their patients through
                the use of this app, send personalised messages and be
                up-to-date with everything they need to know about a patient's
                condition.
