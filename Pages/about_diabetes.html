        <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when our body cannot produce or properly respond to insulin. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar, so our bodies not getting enough insulin means that our blood sugar levels may become too high.<sup><a>1</a></sup></p>

        <p>Now, it is extremely important that we have sugar in our blood. Sugar is the main source of energy for our cells, so this is why having low blood sugar makes us dizzyâ€”our cells will not work properly without sugar!<sup><a>2</a></sup></p>
        
        <p>However, as the proverb goes, &#34;Everything in moderation&#34;; high blood sugar levels are also harmful for us, too.</p>
        
        <h2>About high blood sugar</h2>
        <p>The main reason why high blood sugar is bad for us is that it damages our blood vessels. As a result, our important organs may not get enough blood.<sup><a>3</a></sup> This can lead to illnesses in our:
        <ul>
            <li>Heart</li>
            <li>Brain</li>
            <li>Kidneys</li>
            <li>Eyes</li>
            <li>Teeth</li>
            <li>Feet</li>
            <li>Nerves<sup><a>4</a></sup></li>
        </ul></p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, high blood sugar can also damage our immune system. In a healthy body, our blood vessels produce chemicals to absorb our blood&#39;s white blood cells into our body whenever we get an infection. When our blood sugar levels are high, however, our blood vessels are less capable at absorbing white blood cells. Not only that, too much blood sugar also reduces our white blood cells&#39; efficiency and our body&#39;s ability to produce an alternate protein that would stop the infection.<sup><a>5</a></sup></p>
        
        <h2>Types of diabetes</h2>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes is when our immune system attacks our pancreas, which is the organ that produces insulin. This type of diabetes is most commonly found in younger people, and those who have the disease need to regularly inject insulin to survive.</p>
        
        <p>Type 2 diabetes</p>
        
        <p>Gestational diabetes</p>
        
        <p>Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG)</p>
