# Diabetes@Home

'Diabetes @ Home' is the flagship app from tech-newcomers 'Group xD'.
The app endeavours to simplify and habituate the oftentimes tedious task of keeping track of one's own health data, while also offering client-patient communication features for people with Diabetes. The app allows users to make daily logs of some of the most important health data attributes for diabetes patients (Blood-Glucose Levels, Insulin, Weight, and step-count) and to easily keep track of changes to these health indicators over time. Clinicians, through their own dedicated user-interface can easily glance at (or deeply analyse) this same data for a number of their patients, and critically, provide timely advise and messages of encouragement to help their patients alomng their diabetes journey's.
